# English-Dictionary

### Statement
Describe your project. Why is it interesting? Why is it interesting to you personally? What do you hope to learn? 

### Analysis

We will use data abstraction to implement the game - keep track of the right answers, and accumulate the points from the user's right answers. 

We will use recursion (filter) to parse the received information.

We will use object-orientation to represent the users progress in the game, this will include state-modification.  


### External Technologies
We are using the Oxford Dictionary API to access their database.

### Data Sets or other Source Materials
We will receive from the Oxford Api, a database query and will parse the information using JSON (https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/)

### Deliverable and Demonstration
At the completion of this project we will deliver a software that helps non-native English speakers improve their language skills. It will consists of two parts. First, we will create an interface that displays the definition of a word, requested by the user. In the second part we will use the user search history to create games that will allow the user to practice on their newly acquired vocabulary. 

### Evaluation of Results
We will feel that our project has been successful if we are able to integrate all three parts (GUI, API, data), and runs smothly. That means that a "non-technical" and with limited English language knowledge person can use it, and find it helpful.
